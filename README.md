# Project-Euler
My solutions to the Project Euler problems (found [originally here](https://projecteuler.net), but also in [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/)) in Python 3.8.

In all solutions I tried to reach a function that could answer the same problem with different inputs, so the scripts are longer than necessary in some cases.
